 
Note:

Ken Kozak sent us data from his 2010 Am Nat paper.

I supplemented this with SVL data from the Supp Mat of his 2009 paper on parallel diversification in sympatry.

The supplemented data is in "NA-bio-svl.csv"

The species or populations in these studies fairly matched well with two exceptions:

-the 2010 paper has D._monticola_A and D._monticola_B.  The 2009 paper simply had "Desmognathus monticola".  For this data set, I arbitrarily assigned the single 2009 SVL to "D._monticola_A".

-the 2010 paper has D._wrighti_KHK310 and D._wrighti_KHK73.  The 2009 paper simply had "Desmognathus wrighti".  For this data set, I arbitrarily assigned the single 2009 SVL to "D._wrighti_KHK310".


There were several other instances where the 2010 were not represented by taxa in the 2009 paper, and these were scored as NA.
